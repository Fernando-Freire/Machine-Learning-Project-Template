# How to Convert a Notebook into scritps

In order to convert a jupyter notebook that 
trains machine learning models into well writen 
python scripts there are some steps to follow:

1. The entire notebook should be well written, 
divided into cells in such a way that each cell 
only does a single kind of processing. This will
facilitate the creation of funcions or classes 
in the script version.

2. If the cells in the notebook are well organized,
each of them shoud do one of the following:
 a. import all libraries.
 b. import all datasets.
 c. transform the data from one meaninful state into another.
 d. train the model with one or more datasets.
 e. evaluate the model for each trained dataset.
